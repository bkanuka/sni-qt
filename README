# Summary

This plugin makes Qt applications use the StatusNotifierItem protocol for their
system tray icons. It does so by turning system tray icons created with the
QSystemTrayIcon class into StatusNotifierItems.

This plugin only works when used together with the
"qsystemtrayicon-plugin-system-4.7" Qt branch. This branch is available from
this repository: http://gitorious.org/~agateau/qt/agateau-qt.
