# Summary

This plugin makes Qt applications use the StatusNotifierItem protocol for their
system tray icons. It does so by turning system tray icons created with the
QSystemTrayIcon class into StatusNotifierItems.

You *need* a patched Qt for this to work. The patch is available on Gitorious:

  https://gitorious.org/~agateau/qt/agateau-qt

In the sni-4.7 branch.
