# Summary

This plugin makes Qt applications use the StatusNotifierItem (SNI) protocol for
their system tray icons. It does so by turning system tray icons created with
the QSystemTrayIcon class into StatusNotifierItems.

This plugin only works when used together with the
"qsystemtrayicon-plugin-system-4.7" Qt branch. This branch is available from
this repository: http://gitorious.org/~agateau/qt/agateau-qt.

# SNI category support

QSystemTrayIcon has no concept of categories, so sni-qt will create SNI in the
ApplicationStatus category by default. Application developers can override this
by setting the "_qt_sni_category" property on their QSystemTrayIcon instance.

Valid values for the properties are:
- "ApplicationStatus" (the default)
- "Communications"
- "SystemServices"
- "Hardware"

So for example to create a "Hardware" SNI, one would write:

    QSystemTrayIcon* icon = new QSystemTrayIcon();
    ...
    icon->setProperty("_qt_sni_category", "Hardware");
    ...
